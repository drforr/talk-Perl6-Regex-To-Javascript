# TITLE

From Regular Expressions to Parsing JavaScript

A talk in 29 slides

# DESCRIPTION

Start with basic Perl 6 regular expressions and work up to parsing a small
JavaScript expression.

# TO VIEW

Either 'vim 0*' and use :n to advance through the buffers, or install
the Vroom module/presentation software from metacpan.org

To play along with the samples you will of course need Perl 6, you can find
that at www.perl6.org. The author uses rakudobrew, but you're of course welcome
to use whatever method you like.

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The Perl 6 community in general, and Ingy for the presentation software.
